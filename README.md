# Hey Friends.

Hi! I'm Blake and I'm assuming you're visiting this repo while checking out my resume/portfolio. Thanks by the way for looking it over.

## Resume Page
The resume page is made using the default Gatsbyjs starter through the Gatsby CLI. I cleared everything out of it and made a resume. Currently besides the React framework there is no JS interaction but I may add some interactivity in the future.


## DnD Combat Sim
I had originally made this DnD combat sim in a JSfiddle, but decided I liked it enough to host it on my main website. The .js file for react is at https://github.com/boosterlong/resume-portfolio/blob/main/src/pages/dndsim.js and the functions used are in https://github.com/boosterlong/resume-portfolio/blob/main/src/components/dndfunctions.js .
There are still some changes I'd like to make, but I think it's a pretty neat little program.
### Things to add:

 - Critical Hits
 - Multi-dice attacks
 - Initiative
 - Drop down selector of common enemies
